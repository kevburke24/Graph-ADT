--------

Your repo doesn't have a GraphFactory.java, which needs to be there so that
I can run tests.  Recall that GraphFactory is the class that should have
the createGraph static method.

--------

Your repository doesn't have a folder with this name:

   src/test/java/edu/union/adt/graph/tests/<uname>

that contains any .java files for your jUnit tests. (where <uname> is your
username.)

If you put your tests in a java file in the following folder instead:

   src/test/java/edu/union/adt/graph/tests

please use git mv to move your test java file to the right place. Make sure
you update the package statement in your test file when you make this move.

--------

You don't have a .gitignore file in your repo.  Please add one.
